# Quantum-Error-Correction-Mitigation
Basic error correction is explored for dealing with bit flip and phase flip errors in a circuit that prepares a bell state. After the 9-qubit Shor [9,1,3] code is implemented to correct phase and bit flip errors, a noise mitigation technique is explored using a simulated depolarizing noise model and real hardware.
